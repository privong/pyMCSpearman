# pymcspearman

**Note**: This repository has been archived and is no longer being maintained.
The project has migrated (and expanded) to [pymccorrelation](https://github.com/privong/pymccorrelation).

A tool to calculate Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for data, using bootstrapping and/or perturbation to estimate the uncertainties on the correlation coefficient.
This is a python implementation of [Curran (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3816).
Curran's original C implementation is [`MCSpearman`](https://github.com/PACurran/MCSpearman/) ([ASCL entry](http://ascl.net/1504.008)).

## Status

All three modes (bootstrapping only, perturbing only, and composite) have been tested against Curran's code using the test data provided with `MCSpearman`.
The (not very stringent) tests can be run using the `run_tests()` function or by running `python pymcspearman.py`.

The python implementation is currently noticeably slower than the original C implementation.
For the test data (53 entries) and 1e5 iterations:

### Bootstrap

```
$ time ./mcspearman -infile test.data -i 10000 -method 1
...
real	0m0.389s
user	0m0.385s
sys	0m0.005s

$ time python3 pymcspearman.py    # with only bootstrapping left uncommented
...
real	0m4.542s
user	0m4.475s
sys 	0m0.048s

```

### Perturbation

```
$ time ./mcspearman -infile test.data -i 10000 -method 2
...
real	0m0.330s
user	0m0.320s
sys	0m0.012s

$ time python3 pymcspearman.py    # with only perturbation left uncommented
...
real	0m4.667s
user	0m4.622s
sys 	0m0.025s
```

### Bootstrap & Perturbation

```
$ time ./mcspearman -infile test.data -i 10000 -method 3
...
real	0m0.394s
user	0m0.380s
sys	0m0.011s

$ time python3 pymcspearman.py     # with only composite method left uncommented
...
real	0m5.000s
user	0m4.703s
sys 	0m0.078s
```
